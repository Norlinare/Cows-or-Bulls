1. Copy paste everything to a project.

2. Renaming:

Renamed variable name to userName

Renamed variable nGuess to numberOfPlayerGuesses

Renamed variable name (in showTopList) to userName

Renamed variable playOn to gameIsOngoing

Renamed variable goal to targetNumberToGuess across all of the program

Renamed variable randomGenerator to randomNumberGenerator

Renamed function checkBC to EvaluatePlayerGuess

Renamed variable bbcc to evaluationResult

Renamed "BBBB," into a string variable called correctEvaluation

Renamed makeGoal to SetTargetNumber

Renamed the StreamWriter from output to fileWriter

Renamed answer to playerWantsToContinue

Renamed cows to incorrectPositionNumberCount

Renamed bulls to correctPositionNumberCount

Renamed showTopList to showLeaderboard

Renamed input to fileReader

Renamed line to currentLine

Renamed results to leaderboardData

Renamed pd to playerLeaderboardEntry

Renamed pos to leaderboardPosition

Renamed nameAndScore to currentLeaderboardEntry

Renamed userName to currentLeaderboardName

Renamed guesses to currentLeaderboardGuesses

Renamed p to playerEntry

Renamed Name to name

Renamed NGames to totalGamesPlayed

Renamed totalGuess to _totalPlayerGuesses

Renamed function Update to UpdatePlayerGuesses

Renamed function Average to CalculateAverageGuessesPerGame

Renamed function Equals to EqualsPlayerName

Renamed p to playerData (in Equals function)

Renamed p1 to playerOne

Renamed p2 to playerTwo

3. Breaking out:

3.1:
Created a function called RepeatUntilCorrectAnswer, which will loop so the player have to answer until a correct answer is given.

Broke out the repetition of where the player had to repeatedly guess the target number until the player guesses correctly.

3.2:




4. Added Classes/Functions:

4.1:
GameLogic

Used to store the core game loop as well as functions integral to the core game loop.

RunGame()

Used as a startup sequence for the game, running from Program.cs 

4.2
UserInterface - IO

DisplayGameMessage()

Used to replace Console.WriteLine to imply that the messages are for the game

4.3
GameController - GC

Used to overwrite the old Console.ReadLine. Also takes a message when a prompt is given to the player.

GetPlayerInput()

GetPlayerInputWithPrompt()




To do:

Double check every name

Set up IO Integration for all use of file writing and reading - FileReader and FileWriter as a static class?

Set up UserInterface for console.WriteLine - static class for writing paragraphs

Set up GameController to ReadLines - static class for reading paragraphs

Move the game to game logic - most if not all of it. Free up space in main

Split core game loop into 3? chunks (1 already there?)

Set up a leaderboard class?
